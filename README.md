MongoDB Mini Project — Docker + API (In Progress)
A hands‑on mini‑project demonstrating how to run MongoDB in Docker, connect via VS Code, design collections, and (soon) expose CRUD and aggregation operations through a Node.js API. This project is part of my transition from Senior Database Administrator to Data Platform Engineer, showcasing modern data‑platform tooling, containerisation, and NoSQL fundamentals.

🚀 Project Goals
Build a containerised MongoDB environment using Docker

Connect and manage MongoDB using VS Code MongoDB extension

Design collections and insert sample documents

Implement CRUD operations via a Node.js API (in progress)

Demonstrate indexing and aggregation pipelines (planned)

Deploy a cloud version using MongoDB Atlas (planned)

🧱 Tech Stack
MongoDB Community Edition (Docker container)

Docker Desktop

VS Code MongoDB Extension

Node.js + Express API (coming soon)

MongoDB Atlas (planned)

🐳 Docker Setup
The project includes a full Docker setup for running MongoDB locally:

Pulling MongoDB image

Running container with mounted volume

Connecting via VS Code

Creating collections and inserting documents

See: Mongo-docker-setup/MongoDbSetup.md for detailed steps.

🔌 API Endpoints (Coming Soon)
The API will expose the following:

CRUD
POST /items — Create

GET /items — Read all

GET /items/:id — Read one

PUT /items/:id — Update

DELETE /items/:id — Delete

Aggregation Examples
/items/stats — Basic pipeline

/items/grouped — Grouping + sorting

/items/search — Text search

Indexing Demo
Creating indexes

Measuring performance differences

🧪 Testing (Planned)
Postman collection

Automated tests using Jest

Example API calls

🔐 Security Considerations
.env file for secrets

No credentials committed

Notes on production hardening

Planned: Atlas access rules + IP whitelisting

☁️ MongoDB Atlas Version (Planned)
A cloud‑hosted version of the project will include:

Atlas cluster setup

Connection string configuration

Screenshots of cloud collections

Differences between local Docker vs Atlas

📸 Screenshots
Screenshots include:

Docker container running

VS Code MongoDB extension

Sample documents

(Soon) API responses

(Soon) Atlas dashboard

👋 About Me
I’m Erica — a Senior Database Administrator transitioning into Data Platform Engineering, building modern data skills across SQL Server, PostgreSQL, Oracle, MongoDB, and AWS.

This project is part of my learning path toward the AWS Data Engineer (DEC‑C01) certification.

💬 Feedback Welcome
If you’re a recruiter, engineer, or mentor, I’d love feedback on how to improve this project as I continue building it.
